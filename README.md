# The-Crossing-the-River-with-Wolves-Sheep-and-Cabbage-Puzzle
You have a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage that you need to transport across a river from one side to the other. However, you can only carry one item with you in the boat at a time, and there are some conditions to follow. If the wolf is left alone with the sheep, it will eat the sheep. Likewise, if the sheep is left alone with the cabbage, it will eat the cabbage. How can you successfully transport all three across the river?
Solution:
To solve this puzzle, follow these steps:

Take the sheep across the river and leave it on the other side.
Return alone to the starting side (leaving the sheep on the other side prevents it from being eaten by the wolf).
Take the wolf across the river to the other side.
Take the sheep back to the starting side (you can't leave the wolf and sheep alone together).
Leave the sheep on the starting side and take the cabbage across the river.
Return alone to the other side.
Finally, take the sheep across the river one more time.
Now all three—the wolf, the sheep, and the cabbage—are safely across the river without any of them being eaten.
